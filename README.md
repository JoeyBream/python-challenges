# python-challenges
Completing the challenges found at https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/ by hand.

Further projects:
- Use a code assistant to improve my implementations, including more descriptive variable names or eliminating unecessary functions. 
- Manually test how many of these challenges the latest LLM can complete in their first try.
- Use an LLM to write test cases to against solutions to these functions can be tested.
- Automate the input and testing of different LLMs and create a table which shows their completion rate.
